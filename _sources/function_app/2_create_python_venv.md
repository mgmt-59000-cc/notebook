# Set up Python and a Python Virtual Environment

You will create and deploy an Azure Cloud Function App written in **Python**.

Python programs *should* be run in a "virtual environment" that groups together related dependencies.

I have created a script that will install and activate a virtual environment for you.

## Activate your Virtual Environment
1. At the Cloud Shell command line, enter 
```
start_venv
```

Note that `cf_env` is now part of the terminal prompt. This means that your virtual environment named `cf_env` is currently running and ready for you to create Python code.
